This is my bachelor thesis,
subject: Evaluation the quality of hotel services using emotional analysis algorithms

Based on a dataset that I was given by my supervisor,I export all the usefull informations that was inside like reviewers comment score,based on what criteria the reviewer wrote the specific comment,which is the criteria with the most value for each reviewer etc.
I get all of these informations using different kind of algorithms,using python and bayesian networks.

I used PyCharm and you will probably need to install few libraries in order to execute the program, which I don't remember right now but at compile time errors based on those missing libraries will appear,so you install them then.

I upload it here for couple of reasons,
first of all it may help other people who where in same situation like me before few months,I didn't know anything about emotional analysis algorithms and after a lot of research I got these results, and then, I thought that I may continue this specific project which is a very nice base in order to do many beauties if you devote sometime, like storing the data on a database,create a nice GUI,convert it into a useful tool for every owner of hotel/hostel in order to improve its facilities,services,design etc

# My reference for my thesis

Today's hotels accept their reservations through various websites where customers quote their opinion about the services they offer and that make the websites also function as a valuable source of information. Among these websites, Trivago is one of he most popular, where millions of users comment and interact on a daily basis. Comments determine public opinion / awareness regarding a service, a location, etc..Monitoring and analyzing these comments provides valuable feedback to users. 
Because of the staff of this data, emotion analysis was chosen as a technique for analyzing this data, because of the ease in determining users' views without having to check millions of comments in hand. In this dissertation, we dealt with the analysis of emotion using the dictionary method. To do this, we used a Dataset with 10,276 comments from posts made on the Trivago site as well as some Python commands and libraries. 
The analysis of emotion as a problem can be approached in different ways, however in the present work, after we classified the comments into positive and negative, with the help of the dictionary method we divided them into grades from 1 to 5 depending on how positive or negative they are. Dictionary-based emotion analysis is a computational approach to measuring the emotion that a text conveys to the reader through various keywords
