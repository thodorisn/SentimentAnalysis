This is my bachelor thesis,
subject: Evaluation the quality of hotel services using emotional analysis algorithms

Based on a dataset that I was given by my supervisor,I export all the usefull informations that was inside like reviewers comment score,based on what criteria the reviewer wrote the specific comment,which is the criteria with the most value for each reviewer etc.
I get all of these informations using different kind of algorithms,using python and bayesian networks.

I used PyCharm and you will probably need to install few libraries in order to execute the program, which I don't remember right now but at compile time errors based on those missing libraries will appear,so you install them then.

I upload it here for couple of reasons,
first of all it may help other people who where in same situation like me before few months,I didn't know anything about emotional analysis algorithms and after a lot of research I got these results, and then, I thought that I may continue this specific project which is a very nice base in order to do many beauties if you devote sometime, like storing the data on a database,create a nice GUI,convert it into a useful tool for every owner of hotel/hostel in order to improve its facilities,services,design etc
